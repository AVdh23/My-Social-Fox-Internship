- Worked with Jupyter Notebook to perform the analysis on unemployment in India.
- Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle repository, discovering two datasets - one covering 2019 to 2021 and the other from Jan 2020 to Oct 2020, including the Corona period.
- Started with data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accurate analysis.
- Utilized Plotly Express for various data visualizations:
  1. Bar plots for Unemployment Rate and Labour Participation Rate.
  2. Box plot and average Unemployment Rate bar plot.
  3. Monthly Unemployment Rate analysis.
  4. Regional Analysis scatter plot.
  5. Unemployment Rate before and after Lockdown.
  6. Unemployment Rate change after lockdown.
- Used latitude and longitude to create an interactive Indian map animation, showcasing state-wise unemployment rates.
- Completed a comprehensive analysis of unemployment in India, covering both datasets for 2019 to 2021 and Jan 2020 to Oct 2020.

🎉 Proud of my progress and the insights gained from this task. Looking forward to the next challenges in my internship with Social Fox! 💪💼

🎉 Celebrated completing my last 3 tasks of the internship, feeling healthier and ready for the new challenge!

- Let's dive into the Car Price Prediction project:
  1. Obtained the dataset from Kaggle repository and handled null values for smooth analysis.
  2. Divided the dataset into numerical and categorical features.
  3. Conducted data visualization to gain insights and understanding.
  4. Identified continuous features and dealt with multi-collinearity issues, removing irrelevant features like car_id.
  5. Applied one-hot encoding to handle multiple categorical features efficiently.
  6. Utilized LabelEncoder() for data transformation.
  7. Performed feature scaling to ensure accurate predictions.
  8. Split the data into training and testing sets.
  9. Trained the linear regression model on the data and saved it using joblib.
- Analyzed the model summary for performance evaluation.

🏁 Successfully completed the Car Price Prediction task! 🏆📈 Excited to see how well the model predicts car prices.

🔍 Looking forward to the next challenges and learning opportunities in my Social Price Prediction internship. Let's keep up the momentum! 💪📊
